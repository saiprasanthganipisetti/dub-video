Translation is a medium to transfer knowledge or information. It can be a bridge that connects people from different languages. In our interconnected digital era, the language divide poses a formidable obstacle to the widespread understanding of video content. The better translation must be accepted by all people in logic and based on fact; thus, the message contained in the source language (SL) can satisfy the target language (TL) audience with the information within. It is necessary to achieve effective communication for the Indian audience, especially while dealing
with the English language. A significant solution to deal with this problem is to produce or translate English videos into various Indian languages to meet the intent of the creator and help in mass outreach of the content. The solution is a web-based application using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, which takes an English video and produces the video with 11+ Indian vernacular languages preserving the pace and gender of the original video.
